Occasional tutorials for Sonic-Pi 2

You should be familiar with the contents of the worksheets 

http://www.raspberrypi.org/learning/sonic-pi-2-taster/worksheet.md

before starting to use these

Some of the files contain snippets of code, or complete programs which you can try on your Raspberry Pi.
You can view these files in raw format and copy and paste them into a Sonic Pi 2 workspace. In this case, delete the first line Ruby (+ three ticks) and the last line (three ticks) which are formatting lines to display the file nicely in github, before running the file in Sonic Pi.
